CNN without advanced toolkit. The goal of this code is to develop a runnable python file without the advanced toolkit such as keras. You can run it to see the basis data flow in the network in foward and backward propagation.

# Run
Just run cnnImplement.py in the src/ file.

Any comment is welcomed for bug fixing or improvement.
